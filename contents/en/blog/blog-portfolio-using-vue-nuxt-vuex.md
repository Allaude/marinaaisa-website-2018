## Prueba

When I told my partner I was writing about my obsession with my Peloton bike, she texted this in reply:

“Serious journalist who covered the heights of business and politics now talks about her exercise routine. I can just see the tweets now.”

Look, I get it. There’s more important stuff going on in the world. It feels bizarre to me too that I’ve become an evangelist for a piece of home exercise equipment while democracy as we know it implodes.

Peloton, if you’ve never heard of it, is a stationary bike. Yes, an internet-connected, ultra-high-tech piece of hardware that streams live indoor cycling classes into your home. But still, just a stationary bike. Can it really change your life? According to me, yes, it can. It’s helped me to get through a pretty brutal year, and I’m not ashamed to admit it.

I’m not one of those people who Instagrams their food or Yelps about restaurants. I think I’ve written one TripAdvisor post — about a truly horrific hotel stay — in my life. My natural state is to be decidedly underwhelmed by most things. Living in England for a long time does that to you. I’m also really cheap.

And yet here I am, tracking my favorite instructors on social media, proudly wearing my 100 rides “Century Club” Peloton T-shirt in places other than my own home, nagging my friends to try it out.

I ride every day when I can. Sometimes I’ll even ride twice — in the morning and at night. I’m taking a break from work right now, so I’ve got a lot of time on my hands, but I’m not alone. Peloton has sold more than 150,000 bikes since launching in 2014, and some classes are streamed by more than 20,000 riders.

You can read plenty of technical product reviews of the bike elsewhere, but if you’re wondering about Peloton’s secret sauce and why even hardened cynics like me are such fangirls, I think it’s pretty simple: Peloton taps into your inner athlete, even if you’ve never been one.

I bought my bike in December 2014, after moving from London to Washington, D.C., to cover the presidential race. I must have read about it in a magazine, because it wasn’t a thing yet and hardly anybody had one at the time. I hadn’t even taken an indoor cycling class when I bought it. Not Flywheel, not SoulCycle, not a spinning class at a local gym.

Even though I was working all the time and rarely exercising, I still considered myself “fit.” You know, the kind of person who thinks they’d be able to bust out a 10K or a 50-mile cycling race if push came to shove.

The reality is that I was at least 20 pounds overweight, leading a really unhealthy lifestyle (including smoking), and I was unwilling to spend the time or energy to do anything about it.

Peloton, with its fancy touchscreen and super-fit instructors, seemed to offer a quick fix. How could I not ride it if, being as cheap as I am, I had shelled out $2,600 up front for the bike, including accessories, and was now paying a $40 monthly subscription fee? How could I not use it if I could tap into studio-quality classes live from my own basement?

Pretty easily, as it turns out.

Whenever I actually got on the bike, I enjoyed it. But I found the classes hard and rarely finished one. I always found an excuse to stop — it was too hot in my basement, I was tired, or, most often, I just had to respond to that text or email from work. So the bike sat there in the basement and became what most pieces of home fitness equipment become: a very expensive hanger for drying clothes.

So, what changed?

After moving to New York City for a new job as the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek, I started taking SoulCycle classes on a regular basis, like so many other New Yorkers. I, too, used to make fun of people who did SoulCycle. I thought it was a cult. I didn’t like the the inspirational mantras and its touchy feely mumbo jumbo. I was terrible at what they call “the choreography” and fell off the bike face-first onto the floor during my second class.

But I had a stressful job, a malevolent boss, and a personal life that had me shuttling between New York and London every other week in the midst of a divorce. SoulCycle and its rituals became a refuge, something I came to rely on to feel better about myself both physically and mentally. I got better, and I was surprised by how good I felt about that.
